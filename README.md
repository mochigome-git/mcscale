# Serial Communication with PLC on Raspberry Pi 5

This repository contains code for managing serial communication and interacting with a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) using a Raspberry Pi 5. The code handles reading data from serial devices and writing data to a PLC.

## Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi 5**: The code is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 5.
- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your Raspberry Pi. You can install it using:
```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python3
```
Required Packages: 
- **pyserial**: Used for serial communication
- **pymcprotocol**: Used for communication with the PLC

## Installation
1. Install pyserial:
```bash
pip install pyserial
```
2. Install pymcprotocol: For installing pymcprotocol, use the following command to break system package constraints:
```bash
sudo pip install --break-system-packages pymcprotocol
```

## Usage
1. Set up your serial ports in the **serial_ports** dictionary.
2. Configure the PLC connection with the appropriate IP and port.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Notes
- Ensure that your serial devices are connected properly and the paths in the serial_ports dictionary are correctly specified.
- Modify the pymc3e.connect() parameters to match your PLCâ€™s IP address and port.
